    "In the sciences we measure things.  Data visualization tools are critical to understanding and presenting our results.  This notebook and the accompanying code in the repository will review a number of common plotting tasks.  Gnuplot is handy for quick plotting of functions or to display tabulated data, but we will often want to include plot making into our own programs. This this is possible with Gnuplot, better options exist.  Two tools will be presented (1) the common Python [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) package and (2) the [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) data analysis framework which has common APIs for both C++ and Python ([PyROOT](https://root.cern/manual/python/)).  ROOT is primarily used in particle physics and is aimed at applications when very large datasets need to be analyzed.  In this class you can generally use whatever tools you prefer which may be influenced by your research group's tools and personal preferences.  However, there may be cases where some choice is simply better, so be careful not to limit yourself artifically and to keep an open mind to try new tools to find the best one for the job.  It's always a good thing to have more [tools](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2510:_Modern_Tools)!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin here's a quick, very personal, view of the more generic Python approach versus using a dedicated analysis framework like ROOT.  Of course any number of tools can be combined when building your analysis workflows.  **It's a \"yes and ?\" not and \"either-or\" situation.**\n",

Here PyROOT is able to interpted the numpy arrays.  The reason we specify the length is that numpy arrays are not standard C++ opbjects.  The PyROOT interfaces is acessing the the location data stored in the computer memory.  The length parameter tells the C++ code how much data to read from that address.
